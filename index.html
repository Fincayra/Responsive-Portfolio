        <div id="container"><p>My name is Jay and I am 28 years old, living in Lafayette, Colorado with two dogs and my little black cat. Some of my bigger aspirations include web development, traveling abroad, and settling down somewhere to write novels, but in the meantime I enjoy drawing, easy adventures, casual writing, and some light gaming. I come from a family of artists and have a keen eye for design; I've been building web pages for fun since I was in middle school.<br><br> 
        
            When I was only 4 years old, doctors found I had a brain tumor the size of a fist and operated within a week to save my life. Since then I've lead a healthy and relatively normal life pursuing different degrees in college and briefly settling down in Southern California until twenty years later, in November 2017, that tumor grew back and I was diagnosed with brain cancer. I've undergone three surgeries, two rounds of radiation, and various chemotherapies ever since, and although I've suffered some disability, I continue to overcome these hurdles with more strength and determination than I had before. I still have big dreams of a successful, code-filled future. </p></div>
